# Natural Language Processing
NLP is mainly used for the computers to understand human language and to allow machines to communicate with us ðŸ˜„

# According to the Wiki definition:
**Natural-language processing** (**NLP**) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language data.

# NLP applications
The main applications are listed below:

* Translating the languages,
* Text processing in various languages,
* Automatic summarization,
* Analyzing sentiments,
* Speech recognition,
* Named entity recognition,
* Phrase extraction,
* Tense identification,
* Relationship extraction, etc.
